            <p>I'm currently an Software Engineering Teaching Assistant at <strong >Flatiron School.</strong> During my time at Flatiron, I assisted 50+ software engineering students solve workflow, git, and debugging issues in capstone projects and presented review lectures on Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, React, Redux, SQL, Git, debugging, and pair programming.

            As a <strong>software engineer</strong>, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design â€” combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

            <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably playing soccer, learning to get better at salsa dancing, or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
